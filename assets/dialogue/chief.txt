Hello traveller ! Let me introduce myself. I am the chief of this village, the last bastion of humanity's resistance.
I guess you are the legendary warrior that killed the Elder Dragon. People sing your praises all around the world.
You came at the right moment. Things are getting worse every day, monsters are eveywhere since Diabolo came back to life. You have to defeat him! Or else, we'll be all gone...
The blacksmith will give you the equipment you'll need to fight the monsters. Good Luck warrior!
